The following CSS rule uses a vendor prefix that is no longer necessary or supported by modern browsers:

```css
-webkit-transform: scale(1.1);
```

This can lead to unexpected behavior or styling issues in newer browsers.  The `-webkit-` prefix is primarily associated with older WebKit-based browsers (like older versions of Safari).
